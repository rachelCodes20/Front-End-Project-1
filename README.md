# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution to Frontend Mentor's front-end coding challenge, which I am using to strengthen my coding skills.

## The challenge

My Front End Mentor challenge is to build out this profile card component using style suggestions from the Front End Mentor specifications. The task is to build out the project using the designs inside the `/design` folder. I am building this out while adding some personal touches of my own. The design is in JPG static format, using style elements that promoted a minilistic yet stylish design.

**Thanks for checking out my lil labor of love!** ðŸš€
